apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
the film is strictly routine .
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore 's the scarlet letter .
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash .
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
final verdict : you 've seen it all before .
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .
too bad .
gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
lurid and less than lucid work .
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
while american adobo has its heart -lrb- and its palate -rrb- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
and it 's a lousy one at that .
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire .
without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
... feels as if -lrb- there 's -rrb- a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .
over and over again .
this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
the drama discloses almost nothing .
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .
you can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
why ?
and that is where ararat went astray .
clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
i did n't find much fascination in the swinging .
this is no `` waterboy ! ''
the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .
he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
i 've never seen -lrb- a remake -rrb- do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic ...
the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
the movie is well done , but slow .
the master of disguise is awful .
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
`` looking for leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
... one resurrection too many .
no , i hate it .
the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
contrived pastiche of caper clichés .
if you 're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals .
essentially `` fatal attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .
it does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
` opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
as pedestrian as they come .
why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ?
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
-lrb- the kid 's -rrb- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock 's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .
every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .
unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
there 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
translation : ` we do n't need to try very hard . '
it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -lrb- the characters ' -rrb- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
i also believe that resident evil is not it .
... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
hart 's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
i 'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
with a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard .
the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
there 's some outrageously creative action in the transporter ... -lrb- b -rrb- ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
it 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon\/bourne or his predicament .
like a can of 2-day old coke .
yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did n't .
that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor .
it 's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
nothing about this movie works .
a hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?
never comes together as a coherent whole .
a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies .
like most of jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x.
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after -lrb- seagal 's -rrb- earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat .
that 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` dragonfly . ''
but the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
the redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
amazingly lame .
not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .
parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion '
a cockeyed shot all the way .
clare peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence .
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai 's vaunted empathy .
about one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
enough said , except : film overboard !
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
i 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands .
it 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
it 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
if disney 's cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .
been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
an infuriating film .
seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid .
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
a few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .
yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe .
the biggest problem with roger avary 's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned .
rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories .
it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...
you may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
the movie is a desperate miscalculation .
what they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
the main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of don simpson .
the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
` moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
the star who helped give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears . ''
a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
the master of disguise represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
-lrb- a -rrb- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
once one experiences mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ...
what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
ice cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .
director david fincher and writer david koepp ca n't sustain it .
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1\/2 - hour running time .
with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth .
a ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
... the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .
there 's nothing to gain from watching they .
debut effort by `` project greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
an absurdist spider web .
rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
stay away .
contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source .
the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
decent but dull .
get out your pooper-scoopers .
humor in i spy is so anemic .
there 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .
technically and artistically inept .
... overly melodramatic ...
trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .
... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .
in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
highly uneven and inconsistent ... margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
not once does it come close to being exciting .
it 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
a noble failure .
there 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
any rock pile will do for a set .
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .
a rumor of angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
what 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
while it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
narc is all menace and atmosphere .
there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
-lrb- stevens is -rrb- so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
when -lrb- reno -rrb- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al. , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
despite its visual virtuosity , ` naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't .
the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
the problem with all of this : it 's not really funny .
one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .
it 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard -lrb- eileen walsh -rrb- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
this franchise has not spawned a single good film .
ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .
shame on writer\/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
taken outside the context of the current political climate -lrb- see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! -rrb-
a little weak -- and it is n't that funny .
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
an almost unbearably morbid love story .
a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn .
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .
may puzzle his most ardent fans .
in other words , it 's badder than bad .
after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
the master of disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -lrb- but -rrb- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
but it was n't .
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms. shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
there 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
frida is n't that much different from many a hollywood romance .
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
a lame comedy .
when ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper .
bad movie .
just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
it 's pauly shore awful .
a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .

too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes .
in fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .

the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !
there 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an -lrb- emotionally at least -rrb- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
leaks treacle from every pore .
oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
it 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .
bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
nearly every attempt at humor here is doa .
it 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .
it 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -lrb- 1984 -rrb- to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
... while the humor aspects of ` jason x ' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations .
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .
... hokey art house pretension .
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
it 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
it never rises to its clever what-if concept .
shallow , noisy and pretentious .
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .
could as easily have been called ` under siege 3 : in alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
is it a comedy ?
as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr. murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .
it does n't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity .
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
i walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
the chocolate factory without charlie .
may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
it made me feel unclean , and i 'm the guy who liked there 's something about mary and both american pie movies .
complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
from the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` besotted '' is misbegotten
like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
it should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
... irritating soul-searching garbage .
a humorless journey into a philosophical void .
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
the film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke 's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
quite frankly , i ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
a bit too eager to please .
sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .
a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
the story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
he 's not good with people .
big mistake .
aan opportunity wasted .
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
the pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
you come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
it 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , mad cows .
i 'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .

he fails .
nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
one ca n't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album .

a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
the feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
sex is one of those films that aims to confuse .
first-time director joão pedro rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
more trifle than triumph .
it 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
a depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i do n't think that a.c. will help this movie one bit .
you 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
when the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
utter mush ... conceited pap .
despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script .
... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .

predictably soulless techno-tripe .
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots .
the film 's most improbable feat ?

possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .

a singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .

the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
it 's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .
with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
despite juliet stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime .
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .

a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films .
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita .
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .

how this one escaped the lifetime network i 'll never know .
to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clichés , an assassin 's greatest hits .

a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .

not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
-lrb- a -rrb- stale retread of the '53 original .
there 's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance .
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
to better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience .
at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
a ragbag of cliches .
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
but here 's a movie about it anyway .
i did n't smile .
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -lrb- or worth rooting against , for that matter -rrb- .
befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
it 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies .
the story has little wit and no surprises .
crummy .
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
the french director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .

in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled .
reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
a movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .
has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any oscars .
truly terrible .
it 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears ' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
it looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
its generic villains lack any intrigue -lrb- other than their funny accents -rrb- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24\/7 .

it is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
a muted freak-out
absolutely not .
in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3 . ''
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
it 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
a dreary movie .
cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
the premise itself is just sooooo tired .
the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
... blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
every joke is repeated at least four times .
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .
... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
the crap continues .
it 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !
there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
the most horrific movie experience i 've had since `` ca n't stop the music . ''
comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
while the transgressive trappings -lrb- especially the frank sex scenes -rrb- ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
... hits every cliche we 've come to expect , including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny .
adam sandler 's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash .
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .
not even solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
and in a sense , that 's a liability .
the romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
the paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -lrb- restored -rrb- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic .
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
i do n't think so .
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
almost peerlessly unsettling .
despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds .
suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

there 's no energy .
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .
grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
it 's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
extremely bad .
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .
what 's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
it 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
but it does n't leave you with much .
as the mediterranean sparkles , ` swept away ' sinks .
two-bit potboiler .
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
it 's just rather leaden and dull .
problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
the movie is a mess from start to finish .
but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .

as plain and pedestrian as catsup --
a loquacious and dreary piece of business .
behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
a rather tired exercise in nostalgia .

there 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
one lousy movie .
it 's such a mechanical endeavor -lrb- that -rrb- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
a blair witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity .
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .
-lrb- soderbergh -rrb- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was n't feeling any of it .
this director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
it 's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it .
adam sandler 's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .
a mess .
the characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
what we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
there 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
one of the worst films of 2002 .
lazy , miserable and smug .
-lrb- t -rrb- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
this thing is just garbage .
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
never inspires more than an interested detachment .
instead of trying to bust some blondes , -lrb- diggs -rrb- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
meyjes 's movie , like max rothman 's future , does not work .
but i had a lot of problems with this movie .
it 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
never does `` lilo & stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan . ''
my own minority report is that it stinks .
frankly , it 's pretty stupid .
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
there 's no good answer to that one .
a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
a non-mystery mystery .
there 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos .
feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l.a. to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -lrb- it -rrb- comes off like a hallmark commercial .
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next .
episode ii -- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on `` the simpsons '' has .
dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .

woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending .
there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
what 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense .
lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
`` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time .
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .

and for all the wrong reasons besides .
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .
the movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
