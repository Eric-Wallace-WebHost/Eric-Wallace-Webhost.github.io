a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
jonathan parker 's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .
béart and berling are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent .
a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .
this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force .
may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .
there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
a slick , engrossing melodrama .
the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be .
the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller .
a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man .
a fun ride .
an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch .
` what 's the russian word for wow !? '
otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye .
overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone .
you live the mood rather than savour the story .
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck .
it 's not too fast and not too slow .
it 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .
compellingly watchable .
though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees .
not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .
it 's worth taking the kids to .
dense , exhilarating documentary .
poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures .
methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain .
though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .
a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity .
it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting .
admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ?
this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
cho 's timing is priceless .
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama .
there 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish .
nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .
nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest .
perhaps the best sports movie i 've ever seen .
ou 've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane .
this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life .
playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant .
