This vibration sets the air in rapid motion, and the result is the recording of the sound on our ear-drums. In old telephones, this recording corresponds to a film of sheepskin or bladder drawn over a hollow cup or cylinder. When the head of a drum is struck with a small stick it vibrates. In this case the vibrations are set in motion by the blow, while in the telephone a similar phenomenon is the result of vibratory waves falling from the voice on the thin membrane, or disk of metal, in the transmitter.
